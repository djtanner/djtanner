### Hi there 👋
I am a former product manager who has now transitioned into the world of full stack software engineering. My passion for building and creating software led me to dive into the world of building web applications, game development, and AI.


- 👾 I’m currently working on building web applications mostly using React and Flask and creating games using Lua/Love2d and C#/Unity.

- ☕ I’m also practicing Java, especially for studying data structures and algorithms!

- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.

- ⚡ Ask me about which Legend of Zelda game is my favorite.
