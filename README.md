### Hi there 👋
I am a former product manager who has now transitioned into the world of full stack software engineering. My passion for building and creating innovative solutions led me to dive into the world of React, game development, and procedural generation.

My journey into software engineering has been an exciting one, and I am constantly seeking new challenges to develop my skills and knowledge. I believe that software engineering is not just about coding, but also about understanding users' needs and delivering products that can make a difference in their lives.

On my Github, you will find a range of projects showcasing my technical expertise in these areas, as well as my dedication to delivering high-quality software solutions. I hope to continue learning and collaborating with fellow developers, so feel free to reach out and connect with me!
