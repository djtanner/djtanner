### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a former product manager who has now transitioned into the world of full stack software engineering. My passion for building and creating software led me to dive into the world of building web applications, game development, and AI.

 âš¡ I'm interested in building game engines and tools in C++.

 ðŸ‘¾ I've built web applications mostly using React and Flask and enjoy creating games using Lua/Love2d and C#/Unity.

 â˜• I also enjoy coding in Java, especially for studying data structures and algorithms. And for modding Minecraft.
